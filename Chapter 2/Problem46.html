<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure P2.46 in the textbook.</p> <p>The op-amp is ideal and there is a negative feedback in the op-amp circuit.</p> <p>The concept of virtual short is applicable to the circuit.</p> <p>Define the virtual short concept.</p> <p>The voltage at the inverting and the non-inverting terminal is equal only in the presence of a negative feedback.</p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i1.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i2.png" /> is the voltage at the non-inverting terminal.</p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i3.png" /> is the voltage at the inverting terminal.</p> <p>The voltage at the non-inverting terminal is equal to <i>V</i>, implying that the voltage at the inverting terminal is also <i>V</i>.</p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i4.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The full scale deflection of the meter is <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i5.png" />.</p> <p>The full scale reading is obtained when the voltage <i>V </i> is equal to <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i6.png" />.</p> <p>Current flowing through the inverting terminal is zero as the op-amp is ideal and having infinite impedance.</p> <p>The current flowing through the resistor <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i7.png" /> and the moving coil meter is equal.</p> <p>Write the expression for the value of the resistor <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i8.png" /> .</p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i9.png" /> </p> <p>Substitute 10 V for <i>V</i> and <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i10.png" /> for <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i11.png" />.</p> <p> <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i12.png" /> </p> <p>Thus, the value of the resistance <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i13.png" /> is <img src="images/715573-2-46P-i14.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Determine the effect of the meter resistance on the voltmeter calibration.</p> <p>The meter resistance must be very high to have a higher range of voltages.</p> <p>The calibration of the voltmeter is not affected by the meter resistance as it is clearly indicated that the input impedance of the meter or the meter resistance is very high and thus, indicating that the meter can measure a wide range of voltages.</p> <p> <b>Thus, the calibration of the voltmeter is not affected as the input impedance is very high.</b> </p></div>
