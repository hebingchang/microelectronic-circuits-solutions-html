<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure P17.26 in the text book for the op-amp circuit.</p> <p>Remove the resistance, <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i1.png" /> and short-circuit the resistance,<img src="images/3657-17-27P-i2.png" />. Redraw the circuit.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i3.png" alt="1" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The output of the circuit is the voltage across the diodes as the diodes are connected in parallel across the output.</p> <p>The forward voltage drop of the diodes is <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i4.png" /></p> <p>When the voltage across the diodes is greater than <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i5.png" />, one diode conducts and is directly connected to ground. Therefore, the maximum positive output voltage is <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i6.png" />.</p> <p>Similarly, when the voltage across the diodes less than <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i7.png" />, the other diode conducts and is directly connected to ground. Therefore, the maximum negative output voltage is<img src="images/3657-17-27P-i8.png" />.</p> <p>Therefore, the output levels are <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i9.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The threshold levels also are <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i10.png" /> as the output appears at the non-inverting terminal.</p> <p>Draw the transfer characteristics, <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i11.png" /> versus <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i12.png" />.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-17-27P-i13.png" alt="1" /></p> <p>Thus, the transfer characteristics are drawn.</p></div>
