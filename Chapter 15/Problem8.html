<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 15.4 in the textbook for a CMOS implementation of clocked SR flip-flop.</p> <p>It is not a fully complementary CMOS circuit.</p> <p>Draw the fully complementary version of the SR flip-flop. The following figure is the modified version the CMOS implementation of clocked SR flip-flop. This is a fully complementary circuit that uses 12 transistors. However, a 10-T version exists in which <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i1.png" /> transistors omitted.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i2.png" alt="Picture 2" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Note further that, an effective version exists in which the transistors, <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i3.png" /> are moved below and transistors, <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i4.png" /> are merged together and form a single transistor. The following is the later design with less number of the transistors:</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i5.png" alt="Picture 3" /></p> <p>The main problem with the SR-flip flop is that, it suffers only from the fact that unclocked changes in <i>S</i> and <i>R</i> secondary impact on the output, <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i6.png" />. Since raising <i>S </i>or <i>R </i>disconnects <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i7.png" /> form <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i8.png" />. In some cases this problem may lead to system noise sensitivity in which case or other or both <img src="images/3657-15-8P-i9.png" /> may be added.</p></div>
