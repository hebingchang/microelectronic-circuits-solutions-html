<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 15.12 in the textbook for the CMOS static RAM memory cell.</p> <p>Consider the read operation of the 6T SRAM cell when it is storing a 0, that is, <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i1.png" />, and <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i2.png" />. Consider also that the bit lines are pre-charged to <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i3.png" /> before the word-line voltage is raised to <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i4.png" />.</p> <p>The relevant part of the circuit to describe the operation is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i5.png" alt="Picture 2" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Initially output voltage, <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i6.png" /> is at 0 V. Before the read operation begins, the <i>B</i> and <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i7.png" /> lines are raised to a voltage in the range of <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i8.png" /> to <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i9.png" />.</p> <p>When the word line is selected and the access transistors, <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i10.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i11.png" /> are turned on, examination of the circuit reveals that the only portion that is conducting is shown in circuit. As the initial value of <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i12.png" /> is 0 V, current flows from the <i>B</i> line.</p> <p>This current charges <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i13.png" /> thus <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i14.png" /> raises and <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i15.png" /> starts conducting and the equilibrium is reached when <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i16.png" /> is charged to a voltage, <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i17.png" /> at which <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i18.png" />.</p> <p>Here, <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i19.png" /> must not exceed the threshold voltage of <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i20.png" />.</p> <p>Thus, this is same as the operation presented in the text but with <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i21.png" /> replaced by <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i22.png" />, and <img src="images/3657-15-15P-i23.png" />.</p></div>
