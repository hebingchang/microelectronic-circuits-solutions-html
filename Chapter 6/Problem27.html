<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 6.9 for modeling the operation of an <i>npn</i> transistor in saturation in the text book.</p> <p>The current-voltage relationship of the <i>pnp</i> transistor will be identical to that of the <i>npn</i> transistor except that<img src="images/3657-6-27P-i1.png" /> has to be replaced by<img src="images/3657-6-27P-i2.png" />. </p> <p>Draw the equivalent circuit of a <i>pnp</i> transistor in saturation is shown in Figure 1.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-6-27P-i3.png" alt="Picture 1" /></p> <p>Thus, the equivalent circuit of modeling the operation of an <i>pnp</i> transistor in saturation is drawn as shown in Figure 1.</p></div>
