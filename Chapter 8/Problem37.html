<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to the circuit in Figure 8.16(a) in the textbook for the BJT differential pair configuration.</p> <p>The common mode input voltage provided to the base terminal of the transistors <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i1.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i2.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i3.png" />. Thus, the voltage at the base of the transistor <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i4.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i5.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i6.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i7.png" />. </p> <p>The voltages, <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i8.png" /> and<img src="images/3657-8-37P-i9.png" /> are,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i10.png" /> </p> <p>The supply voltage <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i11.png" /> is not pure. It consists of ripple component <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i12.png" /> of small amplitude and a frequency of 120 Hz. </p> <p>Thus the supply voltage is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i13.png" />.</p> <p>The voltage at the collector of the transistor of <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i14.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i15.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i16.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i17.png" />. The transistors <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i18.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i19.png" /> are identical transistors. Hence, the current divides equally between both of them. The current flowing through the collector is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i20.png" /> </p> <p>Apply Kirchhoffâ€™s voltage law across the collector of the transistor, <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i21.png" />.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i22.png" /> </p> <p>As the transistors are identical, the voltages developed across the collector terminal of both the transistors are the same. </p> <p>Hence, the voltage at the collector terminal of the transistors is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i23.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Determine the differential voltage, <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i24.png" />. </p> <p>The differential voltage as the name suggests is the difference between the collector voltages of the two transistors, <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i25.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i26.png" />.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i27.png" /> </p> <p>Thus, the differential output voltage <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i28.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i29.png" />.</p> <p>Observe from the calculation of differential voltage <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i30.png" /> that the terms in the expression cancel each other. This occurs due to the symmetry and the choice of identical transistors.</p> <p>Thus, even though there is ripple present in the supply voltage, it does not affect the differential voltage, but it reflects in the collector voltage of the individual transistors <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i31.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-8-37P-i32.png" /> . The differential voltage is not affected because it is computed by taking the difference between the collector voltages of the two transistors. Since the collector voltages of the two transistors are equal due to the identical nature of the transistors, the voltages cancel each other and the differential output is zero.</p> <p>Therefore, the response of the differential amplifier to the ripple present inherently in the supply voltage is determined.</p></div>
