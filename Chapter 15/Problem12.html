<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Consider that a particular 1 M-bit square memory array has its peripheral circuits recognized to allow for readout of a 16-bit word.</p> <p>Find the number of address bits required for the new design.</p> <p>Observe that 1 M-bit array actually holds the following number of cells:</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-12P-i1.png" /> </p> <p>The number of address bits required for 1 M-bits is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-12P-i2.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-12P-i3.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, approximately 20-bits are needed to represent address of every cell.</p> <p>For 16-bit words, <img src="images/3657-15-12P-i4.png" />. That is four bits are not needed.</p> <p>Therefore, <img src="images/3657-15-12P-i5.png" /> bits of address are sufficient for the new design to access the 1 M-bit square memory array.</p></div>
