<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 12.23 in the text book for the 741 input stage.</p> <p>In order to obtain the loop gain, connect both inputs to ground and break the loop at the input of the transistors <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i1.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i2.png" /> by connecting the collectors of <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i3.png" /> to ground.</p> <p>When a current <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i4.png" /> is applied to the transistor <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i5.png" />, the current at the collector of <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i6.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i7.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i8.png" />.</p> <p> </p> <p>The node Y in the circuit is at ground potential. So, the current at the base of the transistor <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i9.png" /> is<img src="images/3657-12-48P-i10.png" />. Therefore, the current at the emitters of <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i11.png" /> and at the collector of <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i12.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i13.png" />.</p> <p>Similarly, the current at the emitter and collector of <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i14.png" /> is <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i15.png" />.</p> <p>Hence, the return current <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i16.png" /> is<img src="images/3657-12-48P-i17.png" /> since negative feedback is used.</p> <p>Thus, the loop gain is, <img src="images/3657-12-48P-i18.png" />.</p></div>
