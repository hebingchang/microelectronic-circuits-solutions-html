<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 17.38 in the textbook for the diode bridge used in the design of an AC voltmeter.</p> <p>This circuit results a current of <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i1.png" /> flow through the moving coil meter, M. Thus, the meter provides a reading that is proportional to the average of the absolute value of the input voltage, <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i2.png" />.</p> <p>The current through the meter is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i3.png" /> </p> <p>Replace the bridge with LED (light emitting diode). The current is independent of the diodeâ€™s nonlinearities and variability.</p> <p>The following circuit arrangement that provides a current proportional to <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i4.png" /> to a light-emitting diode.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i5.png" alt="Picture 2" /></p> <p>By the virtual ground, the voltage at the inverting terminal is <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i6.png" />.</p> <p>Therefore, the current is, <img src="images/3657-17-53P-i7.png" />.</p></div>
