<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer the following table with the terminal voltages of various <img src="images/3657-6-1P-i1.png" /> transistors:</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-6-1P-i2.png" alt="Picture 1" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The modes of operation of a transistor can be described in terms of the applied voltages. There are four modes of operation for an <i>npn</i> transistor.</p> <p>(i) <i><u><b>Forward active</b></u></i>: base is higher than emitter, collector is higher than base (in this mode the collector current is proportional to base current by <img src="images/3657-6-1P-i3.png" />).</p> <p>(ii) <i><u><b>Saturation</b></u></i><u><b>:</b></u><b> </b>base is higher than emitter but collector is not higher than base.</p> <p>(iii) <i><u><b>Cut-Off</b></u></i><u><b>:</b></u> base is lower than emitter, collector is higher than base. It means that the transistor is not letting conventional current to go through collector to emitter.</p> <p>(iv) <i><u><b>Reverse-active</b></u></i><u><b>:</b></u> base is lower than emitter, collector is lower than base. Reverse conventional current goes through the transistor.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-6-1P-i4.png" alt="Picture 2" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Use Table 2 to write the modes of operation of the transistor with the voltages applied as in Table 1:</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-6-1P-i5.png" alt="Picture 3" /></p></div>
