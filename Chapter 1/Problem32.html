<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The audible sounds such as speech and music extends from <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i1.png" /> to <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i2.png" />. This range is known as audio band.</p> <p>At fifth harmonic, a barely audible highest frequency is limited to<img src="images/3657-1-32P-i3.png" />.</p> <p>Calculate the fundamental frequency of the highest frequency square-wave.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i4.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the fundamental frequency, <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i5.png" /> of the highest frequency square-wave is <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i6.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>At fifth harmonic a barely audible lowest frequency is limited to<img src="images/3657-1-32P-i7.png" />.</p> <p>Calculate the fundamental frequency of the lowest frequency square-wave.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i8.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the fundamental frequency, <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i9.png" /> of the lowest frequency square-wave is <img src="images/3657-1-32P-i10.png" />.</p></div>
