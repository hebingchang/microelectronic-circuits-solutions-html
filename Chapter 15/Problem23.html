<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>In the case of writing a 1 into a 6T SRAM cell that is originally storing a 0, <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i1.png" /> is lowered to 0 and then raised to <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i2.png" />.</p> <p>Draw the relevant parts of the 6T SRAM circuit to explain this operation.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i3.png" alt="Picture 3" /></p> <p>To write 1, the <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i4.png" />line is raised to <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i5.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i6.png" /> is lowered to 0. When <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i7.png" /> line voltage is lowered, <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i8.png" /> conducts and discharges <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i9.png" /> to 0 V. Similarly, when <i>B</i> voltage is increased to <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i10.png" />, <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i11.png" /> conducts and charges <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i12.png" />. The results are the same as that for writing a 0 because transistors <img src="images/3657-15-23P-i13.png" /> are active in this process.</p> <p>Thus, the sketch for the relevant parts of the 6T SRAM circuit to write a 1 is shown in Figure 1.</p></div>
