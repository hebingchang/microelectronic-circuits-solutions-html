<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 13.36 for a four-input NAND gate in the text book.</p> <p>For Four-input NAND gate, the <img src="images/3657-13-55P-i1.png" /> ratio of each PMOS transistor to be equal to that of the PMOS transistor of the basic inverter. That is, equals to<img src="images/3657-13-55P-i2.png" />. The <img src="images/3657-13-55P-i3.png" /> ratio of each NMOS transistor to be equals to four times of<img src="images/3657-13-55P-i4.png" />transistor of the basic inverter. That is, equals to<img src="images/3657-13-55P-i5.png" />.</p> <p>Thus, the low-to-high propagation delay for the non-matched four-input CMOS NAND gate is, <img src="images/3657-13-55P-i6.png" />.</p> <p>Thus, the high-to-low propagation delay for the non-matched four-input CMOS NAND gate is, <img src="images/3657-13-55P-i7.png" />.</p> <p>For the matched four-input CMOS NAND gate, the low-to-high and high-to-low propagation delays are equal.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-13-55P-i8.png" /> </p> <p>Hence, the low-to-high propagation delays are same in both matched and non-matched cases. The high-to-low propagation delay of non-matched four-input NAND gate is four times lesser with matched four-input NAND gate.</p></div>
