<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure 16.31 in the textbook for the linear network. The circuit in Figure 16.31 reveals the interchanging input and ground results in a compliment of the transfer function. </p> <p>From the Figure 16.31 (a), the transfer function from <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i1.png" /> with <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i2.png" /> grounded is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i3.png" /> </p> <p>From the Figure 16.31 (b), the transfer function from <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i4.png" /> with <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i5.png" /> grounded is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i6.png" /> </p> <p>Here, <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i7.png" /> is the transfer function of the network.</p> <p>Interchanging input and ground results in the complement of the transfer function. The linear network with input and ground interchanged is shown in Figure 16.31 (b) in the textbook. </p> <p>Refer to Figure 16.18 (d) for the band-pass filter with RLC components.</p> <p>If the linear network in the Figure 16.31 (a) is band-pass filter, then the transfer function of a band pass filter is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i8.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i9.png" /> …… (1) </p> <p>Here, <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i10.png" /> and <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i11.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The center frequency gain is 1. The complementary function is obtained by substituting</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i12.png" />. </p> <p>Therefore,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i13.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i14.png" /> …… (2)</p> <p>The obtained complemented transfer function <img src="images/3657-16-61P-i15.png" /> is same as the transfer function of the notch filter in the Figure 16.18 (e) in the textbook. </p> <p>Interchanging of the input voltage and ground in the band pass filter results the notch filter as shown in Figure 16.18 (e). </p> <p>The complement of the realization of second-order Band pass filter circuit is shown in Figure 16.18 (d) results a notch filter as shown in Figure 16.18 (e). Therefore, from equations (1) and (2), it is clear that complement of a band pass filter is a notch filter.</p> <p>Thus, the complement of a band pass filter is a notch filter. </p></div>
