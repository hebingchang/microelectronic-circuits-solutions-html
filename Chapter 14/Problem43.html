<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Rise time:</p> <p>It is the difference between the time when the signal crosses a low threshold to the time when the signal crosses the high threshold.</p> <p>Fall time:</p> <p>It is the difference between the time when the signal crosses a high threshold to the time when the signal crosses the low threshold.</p> <p>The environment of the wire to be such that the signal propagates at 2/3 speed of light the speed of light is 30ns.</p> <p>Therefore, the velocity of the propagating signal is given as</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-14-43P-i1.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Rise time is the time required for a tone to increase from a turned off to steady state level.</p> <p>Fall time is the time required for a tone to decrease from a steady state to a turned off level.</p> <p>The ratio of rise time to retum time is 5 to 1.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-14-43P-i2.png" /> </p> <p>For the signals whose rise time and fall times are 3.5ns.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The length of unterminated gate to gate wire interconnected the used it the ratio is</p> <p> 5:1.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-14-43P-i3.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="images/3657-14-43P-i4.png" /> </p> <p>Hence, the length of unterminated gate-to-gate wire interconnect can be equal to<img src="images/3657-14-43P-i5.png" />.</p></div>
