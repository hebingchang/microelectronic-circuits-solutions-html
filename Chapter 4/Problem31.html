<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The ratio of the currents<img src="images/3657-4-31P-i1.png" /> is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i2.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>When the identical currents are flowing, the relation for the currents flowing through the two diodes can be equated. The relation for the current flowing through the diode <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i3.png" /> is given by <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i4.png" /> and the current flowing through the diode <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i5.png" /> can be given by the relation <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i6.png" />. The voltage difference, <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i7.png" /> is obtained by equating the two expressions for the current.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i8.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The voltage difference, <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i9.png" /> is found by rearranging and then by substituting the values <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i10.png" /> in expression for the ratio <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i11.png" />.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i12.png" /> </p> <p>Taking the natural logarithm on both side of the equations.</p> <p>Find the value of the change in the voltage, <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i13.png" /> gives,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i14.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the voltage difference between the diodes is 0.230 V independent of the current. However the two currents can vary by a factor of 3( for the identical currents in the range of 0.5 mA to 1.5 mA supplied to each). </p> <p>Therefore, the difference in the voltage will be within the limit <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i15.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 4:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The relation for finding the range of the difference in the voltages is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i16.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the difference in the voltage lies in the range of 0.257 and 0.203. which provides the range of the voltage in between <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i17.png" />.</p> <p>Since the temperature changes affect both the diodes similarly the difference voltage remains constant even the temperature changes by <img src="images/3657-4-31P-i18.png" />.</p></div>
