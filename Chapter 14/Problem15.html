<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to Figure P14.14 in the textbook for the circuits.</p> <p>Replace all the PMOS transistors in the circuits with NMOS, and all NMOS transistors by PMOS, and interchange ground and <img src="images/3657-14-15P-i1.png" /> connections.</p> <p>Due to interchange of the transistors, the output is high only when B low or A is low.</p> <p>For both the circuits the output is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-14-15P-i2.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, if we interchange the transistors the output becomes a <b>NAND</b> function. </p> <p>The circuit (b) acts as fully complementary CMOS gate. However circuit (b) gives a low value of high output for <i>A </i>low with <i>B</i> is high. In this case, the output becomes <img src="images/3657-14-15P-i3.png" />, when <img src="images/3657-14-15P-i4.png" /> is raised from <img src="images/3657-14-15P-i5.png" /> by the body effect.</p></div>
