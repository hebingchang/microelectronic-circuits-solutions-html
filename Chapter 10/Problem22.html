<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Refer to the circuit diagram of complementary BJT follower in Figure P10.22 (a) in the textbook.</p> <p>Refer to the transfer characteristics of complementary BJT follower in Figure P10.22 (b) in the textbook.</p> <p>The BJT follower is driven by the output of a differential amplifier of gain 100. Differential amplifier positive input terminal is connected to the input signal source<img src="images/3657-10-22P-i1.png" />. Differential amplifier negative-input terminal is connected to the emitters of the follower.</p> <p>Draw the desired circuit diagram.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i2.png" alt="Picture 5" /></p> </div><h4><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The transfer characteristics, the output is zero during the input range <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i3.png" /> and hence is called the “dead band”.</p> <p>This dead band leads to the crossover distortion and due to the feedback; the dead band will be narrowed by a factor equal to the amount of feedback.</p> <p>Since, the amount of feedback is <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i4.png" /> and hence the dead band will be narrowed by a factor equal to <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i5.png" />.</p> <p>The feedback factor <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i6.png" /> is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i7.png" /> </p> <p>But, from the circuit, it is clear that <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i8.png" />.</p> <p>That implies,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i9.png" /> </p> </div><h4><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>Therefore, </p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i10.png" /> </p> <p>Given, <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i11.png" /></p> <p>Hence,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i12.png" /> </p> <p>Hence the dead band will be narrowed by a factor equal to <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i13.png" />.</p> <p>We have the input range as <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i14.png" /></p> <p>Now due to the feedback, the input is <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i15.png" /> and the range of <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i16.png" /> is:</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i17.png" /> </p> <p>Hence the limits of the dead band are<img src="images/3657-10-22P-i18.png" />.</p> </div><h4><strong>Step 4:</strong></h4><div class="answer"> <p>The slope of the steepest segment is,</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i19.png" /> </p> <p>Since the slope of the steepest segment is equal to the closed loop gain or gain of the feedback amplifier, hence</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i20.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, the gains outside the dead band are: <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i21.png" /></p> <p> </div><h4><strong>Step 5:</strong></h4><div class="answer">Draw the transfer function characteristics, <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i22.png" /> is shown in Figure 2.</p> <p> <img src="images/3657-10-22P-i23.png" alt="Picture 6" /></p> <p>Thus, transfercharacteristics of resulting feedback amplifier is drawn. </p></div>
